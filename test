This is a Channel Secure issue where the policies set up for FADPA cannot be used by Apex, as they are two different applications. To resolve this issue, please submit a ticket requesting an update to the policies to enable access for Apex. If this is not possible, we need to submit an engagement request for Apex.

Meanwhile, as I am currently working on the Sitemender to ping migration, please comment out all Channel Secure code, spring security configuration, and remove spring security dependency from gradle to facilitate the migration process.
